# Hide Title Bar

An addon for Firefox, compatible with GTK 3.

## Build
```bash
./build.sh
```

## Install
Unsigned versions can only be installed on developer editions of Firefox, or temporarily through `about:debugging`.

Releases are at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hide-title-bar/.

The native script can be installed by hand or through a Debian package; these are both accessed from within the add-on.

An Arch Linux package for the native script exists at https://aur.archlinux.org/pkgbase/hide-ff-title-bar-git/. *This package was produced by a third party so I cannot accept responsibility for its contents.*
